   My name is Daniel and I am full stack developer. I graduated from the University of Georgia in May 2015 with a Bachelor's of Arts in International Affairs.
   After graduation, I began my career with Kohl's, one of the largest retailers in the country, as a member of the Executive Development Program.
   The Executive Development Program is a highly selective program for recent college graduates who want to start careers in retail management.
   After six months of intensive training, I was placed in Athens, GA as an assistant store manager.

   While at Kohl's, I oversaw a team of over 80 part - time and full - time employees while managing departments 
   that totaled in over $10 million in yearly revenue.I utilized the business acumen skills I learned in my training
    to ensure steady improvement in sales while using my leadership skills to ensure a friendly and productive atmosphere 
    for employees and customers.

    At Kohl's, I began to realize that my true passion was not in retail but in technology. 
    Growing up, I always was interested in computers. My father had various different desktop computers that we would 
    work on together. In college, I considered this career track; however, I always believed I wasn't good enough at math
    to be a computer science major.
   I currently work at Equipment Management Group in Midtown Atlanta. <
